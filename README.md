## OverlayAnalytics React Evaluation

Thank you for taking the time to partake in our React evaluation. The challenge consists of three parts:

1. A [React task](#react-task) to create a single page React site based on an existing [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/89504f2a-64b3-425a-85f3-905e002add02-dc03/)
2. Recreating an [amChart](https://amcharts.com) component based off of the following [CodePen](https://codepen.io/OverlayAnalytics/pen/WNxgdKB)
3. Answering a few [follow-up questions](#follow-up-questions)

---

You will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Your solution, including your chart component, functions as shown in the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/OverlayAnalytics/pen/WNxgdKB) and [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/89504f2a-64b3-425a-85f3-905e002add02-dc03/)
- Your solution looks like the provided [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/89504f2a-64b3-425a-85f3-905e002add02-dc03/)
- Quality of code and attention to detail

#### React Task

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like while taking the evaluation criteria into consideration.

- You can use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as the starting point for your solution.
- For ease of use, implement using the [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) framework.
- You can use the data from the [data.js](./data.js) file to populate your chart component.
- The amCharts documentation is very extensive and can be found [here](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/).
- Feel free to use any other libraries or packages you like.

#### Chart Component

The goal, is to recreate the chart in this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/OverlayAnalytics/pen/WNxgdKB). The code is written in vanilla javascript but the properties of the chart should be built into a React component. Please utilize the amCharts [documentation](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/) to figure out which properties need to be added/removed in order the match the style of the existing chart.

#### Wireframe Considerations

The wireframe can be found at this **[link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/89504f2a-64b3-425a-85f3-905e002add02-dc03/)**

- The two charts on the wireframe are placeholders, the actual component to be built will be based off of the following [chart](https://codepen.io/OverlayAnalytics/pen/WNxgdKB). Please note, only **one** component needs to be created and can be used in both locations on the wireframe.
- The KPI cards at the top should all share one component and display differently based on props.
- We've provided a design for (1920px), don't worry about tackling any other breakpoints, **please focus on making your solution look good at 1920px in landscape orientation**.
- There are notes and resources provided in the right hand sidebar of the wireframe, **please make sure to take the notes into consideration**. You can find colors and other necessary resources provided in the sidebar.

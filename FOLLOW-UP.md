1. How long did you spend on the evaluation?
	-
2. If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you have added?
   - If I had more time to work on this project, I my first thought out be to add a home page. On the home page, a feature that I think would provide an extra level of usability would be the the ability to filter the invoices by month to provide totals. For example, when a user signs on, they would see this this months invoice totals.
3. Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
   - The part of this project that I am most proud of is the amChart graph. This is my first experience using a graphing library, and it was a fun challenge to have to utilize documentation to build the graph. The other aspect of it that makes me proud was integrating the graphs into the rest of the project that uses Material UI.
4. Which parts did you spend the most time on? What was the most difficult aspect?
   - Most of my time was spent on styling the website while using Material UI. With the amount of components available and never having used the library I found it difficult to achieve the CSS that matched the wireframe.
5. How did you like the evaluation overall? Did you run into any issues or have trouble completing?
   - Overall, I thought the evaluation was a fun challenge. Because of my lack of experience with amCharts and material ui I found that the challenge of building the evaluation along with learning via documentation as I went challenging. The main issues I ran into were centered around styling the evaluation through Material UI.
6. Do you have any suggestions or improvements for how we could improve the evaluation in your mind?
   - Overall I think the evaluation was a good test on if someone could combine amCharts & Material UI effectively.
